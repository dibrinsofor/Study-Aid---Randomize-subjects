## study aid - randomize subjects

i wrote this python script to help randomize the order of subjects or tasks i do/read daily so that they feel less repetitive.

### potential additions

as i continue to use this i imagine i may need to:

- find a way to make sure i don't get the same order two times in a week.
- i also imagine i can find a waay to automate this so the script can automatically run on startup and open up a window that will allow me check things off as i do them.

## if you would like to use this

```
clone the repository. git clone
```
```
run the file. python run randomizesubjects.py
```
